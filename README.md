# postil Demo

This project is a demo showing how to use [postil data](https://github.com/postil/postil-example).

It's a simple, not very well designed React webapp that shows auto completions
for cities, streets and houses. You should use it as a reference for how to use
the API rather than as a reference for how to code / how to use react.
